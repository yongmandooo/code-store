handout: This directory contains all the documents(instructions)
sample_input: Base cases (inputs) & (the output generated by your code)
sample_output: Base cases (outputs)
assembler.py: skeleton code (you should put your implementation in this file)

Testing your code locally(in the top directory of CSE26101_PA1):
'''
python3 assembler.py sample_input/[INPUT_FILENAME.S]
diff sample_input/[INPUT_FILENAME.O] sample_output/[INPUT_FILENAME.O]
'''

no output -> pass!!
any output -> fail!!
